# KEGG (Kyoto Genes and Genomes Encyclopedia) python modules and notebook
This is a repository I made with: 
- a notebook on the basic functions of the KEGG API and how to use it.;
- python module to retrieve KEGG info such as name and description and convert it to a csv table.
  
Feel free to use in your code or add improvements to it. Hopefully it will be helpful!
